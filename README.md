# COVID-19-Analytics

Eight Machine Learning Algorithms (Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, K-Nearest Neighbours, K-Means Algorithm, Support Vector Machines, Gradient Boosting, Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression) and two Deep Learning Neural Network models (Single layer perceptron and Multi layered Perceptron) were trained and tested on the UN Covid dataset (kaggle) and the model with best accuracy percentile was employed to built the web-predictor. Multi-layered Perceptron provides 97.7% Accuracy and thus was employed for the model building.

The web app was built in Python using the following libraries:

pandas

scikitlearn

seaborn

matplotlib.pyplot

pickle
